Project Idea: Predictive Maintenance for Machinery
Objective
Predict when a machine or equipment is likely to fail so that maintenance can be performed proactively.

Key Learning Goals
Time-Series Data Handling: Learn how to handle and process time-series data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that help in predicting failures.
Anomaly Detection: Understand and implement anomaly detection techniques.
Model Evaluation: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves for evaluating classification models.
Advanced Visualization: Visualize time-series data and model predictions.
Steps to Complete the Project
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dataset: Use a public dataset like the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set or the Predictive Maintenance Dataset from Kaggle.
Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize the data, and perform any necessary data cleaning steps.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plot time-series data to understand trends and patterns.
Calculate summary statistics and visualize correlations between different features.
3. Feature Engineering
Rolling Statistics: Create rolling mean and standard deviation features.
Lag Features: Generate lag features to capture the relationship between past and current values.
Domain-Specific Features: Create features based on domain knowledge, such as usage duration or cycles since last maintenance.
4. Model Development
Baseline Model: Start with a simple model like Linear Regression or Decision Tree to establish a baseline.
Advanced Models: Implement more advanced models like Gradient Boosting, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time-series, or Random Forest.
Anomaly Detection: Use algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM to detect anomalies that could indicate potential failures.
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics suitable for imbalanced data like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
6. Visualization and Reporting
Time-Series Plots: Visualize the actual vs. predicted maintenance needs over time.
Anomaly Detection Results: Plot detected anomalies and correlate them with actual failures.
Report: Summarize findings, methodologies, and model performance in a comprehensive report.
